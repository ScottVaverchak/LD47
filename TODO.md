# TODO List 


 * Add levels 
 * Add beeps and boops sound effects 
 * Add anti-gravity gun (think rocket launcher but without the big boom)
    * Distance from a surface will determine how far you go 
    * Surface material will also effect this
 * Switch to a physics based movement system 

## Completed but needs love

 * Add items that give you time
 * Gun Sway should be smoother and more controllable
 * Jumping is still pretty sloppy 
 * Add spawn point
