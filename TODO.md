# TODO List

## Main ones

 * Add beeps and boops sound effects 
 * Models!
    * TimePoints
    * Start/Finish geo
    * Level pieces

## Completed but needs love

 * Add items that give you time
 * Gun Sway should be smoother and more controllable
 * Add spawn point
    * Spawn point should have an orientation
 * Switch to a physics based movement system 
    * Movement is a bit meh - need to tweak it via physics
 * Add anti-gravity gun (think rocket launcher but without the big boom)
