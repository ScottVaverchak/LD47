# TODO List 

## Current

 * Add anti-gravity gun (think rocket launcher but without the big boom)
    * Distance from a surface will determine how far you go 

## Main ones

 * Add levels 
 * Add beeps and boops sound effects 

## Completed but needs love

 * Add items that give you time
 * Gun Sway should be smoother and more controllable
 * Jumping is still pretty sloppy 
 * Add spawn point
 * Switch to a physics based movement system
